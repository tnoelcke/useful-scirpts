# useful-scirpts
Repo with some useful scripts I use on a daily basis.

## TFS
undo-pending.bat - A script that I use to undo all pending changes for a user in a workspace to prevent TFS from locking thier shelf sets or other related sorce code.
Use wisely as this could piss of your coworkers if they frequently leave pending changes locally.
